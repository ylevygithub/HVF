### Jolokia Real Pepper Spices

The Jolokia spice held the title of the world's hottest pepper for some time. It tastes so good that even a dragon would breathe fire.

Jolokia spice is used to add intense heat and flavour to a variety of dishes, particularly in Indian, South Asian and South-East Asian cuisines. It is commonly used in pickles, chutneys, hot sauces and as a seasoning in curries and stews.
